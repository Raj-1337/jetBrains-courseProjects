age which is required for understanding the given piece of text.
* It has four different approaches, you can select either one of them or all of them to get an approximate minimum age.

    >* All outputs score of all the above and gives an approximate age from those.
* scores are calculated based on following parameters:  
    >* number of characters
    >* number of words
    >* number of sentences
    >* number of syllables  
    >* number of polysyllables
* Syllables are counted in a word as:  
   > * number of vowels in a word.
   > * "e" at the end of the word is not counted.
   > * double vowels for example "ai" in "flair" is counted as 1.
   > * if the word has no vowel or has only "e" and ends with it, the enitre syllable of the word is 1.
* Polysyllables - number of words with more than 2 syllables.
